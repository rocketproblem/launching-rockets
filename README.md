# launching-rockets 


Beginner Python project to learn about handling a data set.

In this project, you will learn to organize data sets using `for` loops, dictionaries and lists to find the right amount of materials needed to launch a rocket.

## Difficulty Level:  BEGINNER

To understand this project, you should have basic experience with for loops, while loops, dictionaries, and lists. There are three levels for this project, each getting progressively harder.

## The Story

A tragedy was averted after we managed to catch a thief who was sneaking into our databanks for reasons unknown, but unfortunately, they managed to scramble the information we have before being caught. We need to unscramble the data or we wonâ€™t be able to launch any more rockets.

## What you will learn

In this project, you will learn MORE about:
* `for` loops
* Dictionaries
* Lists
* `if` statements
